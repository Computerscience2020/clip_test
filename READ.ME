OpenAI's CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining) is a powerful multimodal model that can understand both images and text, making it versatile for various tasks involving both visual and language elements. Here are the key capabilities of CLIP:

     1. Zero-Shot Classification
   - Capability: CLIP can classify images without explicit training on a particular dataset for that specific task. This is because CLIP is trained on a wide range of images and text descriptions, allowing it to generalize well to new, unseen categories.
   - Example: Given an image of a dog, and a set of text labels like `"dog"`, `"cat"`, `"horse"`, etc., CLIP can predict the correct label without having been explicitly trained on that specific classification problem.
